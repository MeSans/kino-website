Everything is an object.

Is garbage collected.



C# pitfalls:
    Value types get default values on creation. So check values emptyness by myvalue.isEmpty()
    Garbage collection deletes objects asynchronously.
    Donâ€™t free system resources like connection to files in destructors. Rather free them as soon as you are finished with them. Just use using like this:(calls dispose hell or high-water)
    using (FileStream myFile = File.OpenRead("foo.txt")) {
    myFile.Read(buffer, 0, 100);
  }
    Cast shit like this (something else)something. This throws InvalidCastException is impossible
    Just a motherfucking function: http://csharp.net-tutorials.com/csharp-3.0/extension-methods/
